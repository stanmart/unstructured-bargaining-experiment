<p> We will now discuss how the group is formed at the end of the round. </p>

<h4> Accepting proposals </h4>

<p> 
    During the five minutes of discussion and bargaining <b>you can change which proposal you currently accept any number of times.
    At the end of the five minutes, everyone's currently accepted proposal becomes final.</b>
    The "Currently accepted proposal" interface for this is shown below.  You can see which proposal ID each player currently accepts (or whether they reject all, by choosing "—"). 
    In the row below you see which payoffs these choices would lead to.
</p>

<h5> Try it yourself </h5>

<div>
    <p>
            As an illustration, suppose you are <span style="color: #056fb7; font-weight: bold;">Player {{player_name}}.</span><div class=""></div> 
    </p>
    <p>Please perform the following tasks:</p>
    <ul>
        <li id="task-submit-preferred">Submit a preferred proposal <span class="checkmark" style="visibility: hidden;">✅</span></li>
        <li id="task-clear-preferred">Clear your preferred proposal <span class="checkmark" style="visibility: hidden;">✅</span></li>
    </ul>
    (The proposal IDs in this exercise refer to the proposals under "All Proposals" below, though it does not matter for this exercise what exactly the proposals are.)

<h4> Group formation </h4>
<p> 
    After the five minutes of discussion and bargaining, the final outcome and the payoffs of this round are determined as follows:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <span style="color: #b70505; font-weight: bold;"> 
                Only if <u> all players in a proposed group </u> agree on the same proposal ID is that proposal successful. 
            </span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span style="color: #b70505; font-weight: bold;"> 
                Note that <u>players who are not included in a proposal (marked as "—") do not have to agree to it for it to be successful</u>.
            </span>
        </li>
    </ul>
    The group is then successfully formed and its members' payoffs are determined by the agreed-upon proposal. 
    All other players get 0. 
    <span style="color: #b70505; font-weight: bold;"> If there is no such agreement, all three players get 0. </span>
</p>

{{ if not last_player_is_dummy }}
    <p> Note that because Player {{P1}} has to be included for a group to receive a budget, there will be one group at most.</p>
{{ else }}
    <p> Note that because Player {{P1}} and Player {{P2}} have to be included for a group to receive a budget, there will be one group at most.</p>
{{ endif }}

<h5> Try it yourself </h5>

<div>
    <p>
        Here is an example of a game where a number of proposals were made. To get a better idea about how group formation works, you will now try out various combinations of acceptance decisions.
        <b> This is just for illustration purposes: in the actual experiment, you will not be able to modify the choices of other players. </b>
    </p>

    <p> 
        For each of the criteria below, set the accepted proposal IDs such that it is satisfied. 
        Once you satisfy a criterion, it turns green and a checkmark appears.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li id="grand-coalition">All players form a group <span class="checkmark" style="visibility: hidden;">✅</span></li>
        <li id="sub-coalition">Not all players agree, but a smaller group is formed <span class="checkmark" style="visibility: hidden;">✅</span></li>
        <li id="no-coalition">No group is formed <span class="checkmark" style="visibility: hidden;">✅</span></li>
    </ul>
