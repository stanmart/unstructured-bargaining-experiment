<p> We will now discuss how the group is formed at the end of the round. </p>

<h4> Group formation </h4>
<p> 
    During the bargaining stage, you can select which offer you currently prefer.
    The interface also displays the payoffs that would result from the current choices.
    At the end of the five minutes of discussion and bargaining, the currently accepted offer becomes final. 
    Payoffs are then determined based on these final choices.
</p>

<p> 
    Once the round ends, the final outcome and the payoffs of this round are determined as follows: 
    <span style="color: #b70505; font-weight: bold;"> 
        Only if <u> all players in a proposed group </u> agree on the same proposal is that proposal successful.
        Note, that <u>players who are not included in a proposal do not have to agree to it</u>.
    </span>
    The group is then successfully formed and its members' payoffs are then determined by the agreed-upon proposal. 
    All other players get 0. 
    <span style="color: #b70505; font-weight: bold;"> If there is no such agreement, all three players get 0. </span>
</p>
<p> Note that because Player 1 has to be included for a group to receive a budget, there will be one group at most.</p>

<h5> Try it yourself </h5>

<div>
    <p>
        To get a better idea about how group formation works, you will now try out various combinations of acceptance decisions.
        <b> This is just for illustration purposes: in the actual experiment, you will not be able to modify the choices of other players. </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is an example of a game where four proposals were made.
        As before, "All proposals" is a table of offers. 
        
        In the "Choose a proposal" interface you can set which proposal ID each player accepts (or whether they reject all, by choosing "-"). 
        In the row below you see which payoffs these choices would lead to.

    </p>
    <p> 
        For each of the criteria below, set the accepted proposal IDs such that it is satisfied. 
        Once you satisfy a criterion, it turns green and a checkmark appears.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li id="grand-coalition">All players form a group <span class="checkmark" style="visibility: hidden;">✅</span></li>
        <li id="sub-coalition">Not all players agree, but a smaller group is formed <span class="checkmark" style="visibility: hidden;">✅</span></li>
        <li id="no-coalition">No group is formed <span class="checkmark" style="visibility: hidden;">✅</span></li>

<h4> Currently preferred proposal </h4>

<p> 
    During the five minutes of discussion and bargaining you can change your choice on which proposal you accept any number of times (see below for how the interface looks).
    At the end of the five minutes, everyone's currently accepted proposal becomes final.
</p>

<p> 
    This interface works very similarly to the "Choose a proposal" interface above. 
    The main difference is that you can only make a choice for yourself (the choices of other players are fixed).
    (Just submit a new ID, or alternatively click "Revoke acceptance" if you do not wish to accept any of the proposals.)
