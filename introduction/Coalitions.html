    <h4> <b> The bargaining outcomes </b> </h4>
    Once all players have made their decision, you will see the resulting bargaining outcome on this page. 
    You will see which player chose which proposal ID and the resulting payment. 
    (For reference all proposals will be displayed again.)
    <ul> 
        <li> 
            <p> <u> Example 1: </u>  </p>
            <img src="{{ static 'bargaining_outcome.jpg' }}" width="500"/>
            <p> Player 1, 4 and 5 successfully agreed on a group and an allocation. Their payments are 30, 10 and 10, respectively. </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
            <p> <u> Example 2: </u>  </p>
            <img src="{{ static 'bargaining_outcome_failed.jpg' }}" width="500"/>
            <p> There was no agreement within a group because Player 1 rejected all proposals. As a result, all players get 0. </p>

    </ul>
