<p> In this experiment you will play first a trial round (round 0) and then four regular rounds (round 1-4) of the following bargaining game: </p>

<p>
    <h4> The general structure: </h4> 
    You will play a bargaining game in groups of five ("Player 1/2/3/4/5"). Each bargaining round will last <b>five minutes</b>.  
    The game will be the same for each group.
    After each bargaining round, the groups will be reshuffled. 
    It will be done in such a way that you are unlikely to play with the same participants more than once.
    Player numbers will also be reshuffled.
    Also note that the reshuffling and your player number will not depend in any way on how you play.
</p>

<p>
    <h4> The game: </h4>
    Any subset of the five players in the group can form a subgroup. 
    Each subgroup generates some value (denoted in CHF).
    The value the subgroup generates depends on its members:
    <ul>
        <li>If Player 1 is not in the subgroup, the value is 0.</li>
        <li>If Player 1 is in the subgroup, the value is increasing in the number of members (see table and graph below for an example).</li>
        <li> <b> Only in round 4:</b> The subgroup value does not depend on whether Player 5 is in the subgroup or not.</li>
    </ul>

   <p>  Note that the value each subgroup generates can vary from round to round. </p>
   

    
</p>
<p>
    Every player has to two decisions to make: which players form a subgroup and how the value of that subgroup is allocated among its members. 
    You can only submit positive integer values as allocations. 
    At the end of the bargaining, each player submits their answer.
</p>
<p>
    The payments of this round are then computed as follows: 
            <b> Only if <u> all members of a proposed subgroup </u> agree on the same allocation will the bargaining be successful.  </b>
            The subgroup members will then be paid according to the agreed-upon allocation, everyone else gets 0.
            <b> Otherwise, everyone in the group gets 0 in this round. </b>
</p>
<p> 
    You will receive money at the end of the experiment. 
    Your payment at the end of the experiment will consist of the the show-up fee of CHF 10 plus your payment randomly drawn from one of the (non-trial) rounds you played.
