<p> 
    You play with two other players. 
</p>

<p> 
    You can form a group with as many of these players as you like. The group will receive a budget which can be distributed freely among its group members. 
    The size of the budget depends on the size of the group and who is in the group (more details on this on the next page).
</p>

<p> 
    You have <b> five minutes </b> to discuss and bargain in a <b> chat</b> with the other two players about which group you want to form and how you want to distribute its budget among its group members.  
    After the five minutes, at most one group will form (more details on the group formation later).  
</p>

<p> 
    In each round, you will play with different participants. (Who you play with will not depend on your decisions and payoffs in the previous rounds.)
</p>

<p> 
    On the next pages we will explain the rules and the experiment interface in more detail.
