In this experiment you will play four rounds of the following bargaining game: 

<p>
    The general structure: 
    You will bargain in groups of five. The game will be the same for each group.
    After each bargaining the round, the groups will be reshuffled. In particular, the groups will not overlap across rounds, so you will never play with the same person twice.
    Each bargaining round will last five minutes. It will automatically end after five minutes.
</p>

<p>
    The game: In each group there are two types of players: B and S. There is always exactly one player with type B, all other four players have type S.
    The roles will be randomly assigned in each round. Any subgroup of players can form a coalition. 
</p>

<p> 
    What you will bargain over: 
    As a group you will have two decisions to make: which players will form a coalition and how the payoff from that coalition will be shared among the players of that coalition. 

    Only if all members of the coalition enter the same allocation [other word] will the payoff be paid out.
    Otherwise, everyone in the group gets 0 in this round.
</p>

<p>
    The bargaining in each round: 
    You will bargain over a text chat, you can do so in any way you like. There is only one group chat for everyone in the group, private chats are not possible.
    At the end of the five minutes, every person in your group has to enter their answer [need a better word].
</p>

<p> 
    Payment: 
    The payment will be randomly drawn from any of the bargaining outcomes of the four rounds.  
</p>

If you have any questions on the game, please raise your hand now and an experimenter will come to you.
