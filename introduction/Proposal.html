<p> On this page, we explain how the group budget is determined and how you can make a proposal. </p>

<h4> Group budgets </h4>

<p> 
    You and the two other players will each be randomly assigned a player role ({{P1}}, {{P2}}, {{P3}}). 
    <b> The player roles will be reassigned each round. </b>
</p>
{{ if not last_player_is_dummy }}
<p>
    <b> 
        A group needs to include Player {{P1}} to receive any budget. 
        The more members a group has, the bigger the budget:
    </b>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>If Player {{P1}} and one other player form a group together, they have a budget of {{small_coalition_value}} CHF.</li>
    <li>If all three players form a group together, they have a budget of {{grand_coalition_value}} CHF.</li>
</ul>
{{ else }}
<p>
    <b> 
        A group needs to include Players {{P1}} and {{P2}} to receive a budget of CHF {{grand_coalition_value}}. 
        The group budget does not depend on Player {{P3}}'s inclusion. They can still be included in any group.
    </b>
</p>
{{ endif }}

<p>
    This information is also summarized in a table and a corresponding graph for reference during the discussion and bargaining phase (see below: "Group budgets").
</p>



<h4> Make a proposal </h4>
<p> 
    When you want to make a new proposal for which group to form and how to split its budget, you submit it in the "Make a proposal" interface (see below).
    For each proposal, simply select the players you want to include in the group and then enter the amount they get below (you can only enter positive, whole numbers).
    On the right you see two totals: the budget that is available to this group (top) and how much you have already distributed among the group members (bottom).

</p>
<p> 
    <b> During the five minutes of the discussion phase, you can make as many proposals as you like. Furthermore, proposals are not binding. </b>
</p>

<h4> Past proposals </h4>
<p> 
    Once a new proposal is made, it is added to the table "Past proposals" (see below).
    This gives an overview of all proposals that have been made so far. 
    Each row corresponds to one proposal.
    In the first column, you see the "ID" of the proposal (this is just the number of the proposal, e.g. the second proposal that was made has the ID 2), this is used for easier reference later on. 
    In the second column you see who made the proposal. 
    In the remaining three columns you see which amount each player gets in this proposal.
    Players not included in the proposed group are marked with "—".

<h4> Try it yourself </h4>
<p> 
    <div>
        <p>  To become more familiar with the interface, we ask you to complete the following small exercise: </p>
        <p>
            For each of the criteria below, make a proposal that satisfies it. 
            Once a criterion is satisfied, it will turn green and a check mark will appear.
            Note that a proposal can satisfy more than one criterion at the same time.   
        </p>
